Octave knows about arithmetic operations (`+,-,*,/`), exponentiation (`^`), natural logarithms/exponents (`log`, `exp`), and the trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, \u2026). Moreover, Octave calculations work on real or imaginary numbers (i,j). In addition, some mathematical constants such as the base of the natural logarithm (`e`) and the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter (`pi`) are pre-defined.\n",
